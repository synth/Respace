This is a simple facebook app written with camping

This isn't really meant to be distributed as Respace is running on my server and can be accessed on facebook here: http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=100817573303266

I'm making this available so you can see how you can use Camping as a lightweight facebook app that uses the new Facebook GraphAPI

However, I would love help on making this more stable as I never really got the OAuth authentication solid here and seem to be having problems with cookie handling...
